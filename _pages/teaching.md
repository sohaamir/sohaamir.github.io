### University of Birmingham

Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Cognitive Neuroscience (MSc module) (Module convenor: [Dr Magdalena Chechlacz](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/chechlacz-magda.aspx))

Served as a teaching assistant for practical workshops (25 students per class) covering: 
- Basics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data (file types, loading, reading and viewing files)
- Introduction to Programming (Linux, bash)
- Using FSL to perform neuroimaging analyses (diffusion MRI, resting-state and task-based fMRI)

As part of the module I created and ran a tutorial in conducting group-level resting-state fMRI using FSL. Committed to open-source education, you can find these materials (along with an introduction to neuroimaging in Python) [here](https://sohaamir.github.io/MRICN/). 

### University of Reading 

Introduction to Neuroscience Methods (BSc module) (Module convenor: [Professor Anastasia Christakou](https://anastasia.christakou.org/))

Served as a teaching assistant with [Dr Rich Harrison](http://richaharrison.com/) for group tutorials (20 students per class) covering: 
- Introduction to Neuroimaging (principles of MRI/fMRI, TMS, EEG)
- Constructing Research Hypotheses and Experimental Design
- Neuroethics 
- Practical tour and demonstration of CINN laboratories (MRI, EEG, TMS)
