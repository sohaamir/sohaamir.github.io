I am retrospectively writing this from the CHBH ðŸŒš but I thought I would write a quick post saying goodbye to all the CINNers at the University of Reading who supported me over the past two-and-a-half-years. I honestly learned so much and am extremely grateful for everything! I look forward to keeping you updated with my PhD and getting our projects published! ðŸŽ†

Best,  
Aamir
