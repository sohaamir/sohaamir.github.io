      <p class="lead"><b>Scientific work in the age of Generative AI</b></p>
      
      <p><b>Generative AI has significantly altered how scientific work is conducted.</b> Across disciplines, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-025-07438-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researchers increasingly deploy large language models (LLMs)</a> for tasks once considered demonstrations of scientific skillâ€”from literature synthesis to experimental design to manuscript writing.</p>
      
      <p>However, rather than aiding scientists with progressing their own individuality, <b>LLMs often directly replace the need to engage in critical and creative thinking</b>, and stifle the development of practical skills (e.g., coding). This creates a paradox with troubling implications for scientific training: LLMs may amplify productivity but consequently erode the cognitive foundation of scientific competence.</p>

      <p>To better aid academics maintain their scientific autonomy and discipline, we develop a <b>framework necessitating the development of AI meta-skills: strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration.</b> These meta-skills are vital for appropriately evaluating AI outputs and combining them with one's own expertise, instead of blindly following suggested responses. Ultimately, we aim to develop a framework by which researchers develop AI-augmented expertise, which is necessary to shape a future where technology amplifies, rather than attenuates, scientific thought.</p>

      <p class="lead"><b>Computational mechanisms of mentalization in humans and machines</b></p>
      
      <p><b>Mentalization is a cognitive process associated with interpreting the behaviour of others as the results of latent mental states, beliefs and emotions.</b> In humans, mentalization shapes behaviour in social contexts by predicting the actions of others and adjusting one's own behaviour accordingly. For example in a game of Rock, Paper Scissors, you may predict that the opponent will choose 'Rock' and so choose 'Paper' yourself! Yet, <b>whether LLMs also are able to engage in mentalization is currently unclear,</b> as the tasks and assessments commonly used may not be suitable for assessing complex cognitive processes, only describing superficial elements of behaviour.</p>
      
      <p>Previous studies have levied computational modeling to uncover the latent cognitive processes underlying mentalization in humans. This includes those using the <b>'Inspection game'</b> where mentalizing about the opponents actions results in a higher payoff, as well as the <b>Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)</b> style of games, where ultimately an agent can simulate the opponents action at various levels of recursion.</p>

      <p>In our study, we aim to employ <b>computational modeling to uncover latent parameters of mentalization and strategic play among LLMs</b> by testing two simple repeated economic games, the Inspection game and RPS, both previously used to determine the computational basis of mentalizing in humans. We will employ state-of-the-art <a href="https://alpn-lab.github.io/BayesCog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>hierarchical Bayesian modeling</b></a> to account for differences in model provider and prompting strategy and compare results to existing human data in both studies as a comparative measure across human and artificial intelligence.</p>

<!-- Social learning in groups -->

      <p class="lead"><b>Transdiagnostic influences on social decision-making in groups</b></p>
      
      <p>In social environments, decision-making in humans is guided by learning, <b>both from personal experience (experiential learning), and from observing the actions and choices of others (observational learning).</b> Recent literature has demonstrated social learning biases across a range of psychopathologies. Whereas individuals with <b>social anxiety and depression are more likely</b> to conform to others' behaviour or judgements, those with higher levels of primary <b>psychopathic traits conversely engage in selfish decision-making</b> and exhibit reduced cooperation with others. </p>
      
      <p>However, high-levels of heterogeneity observed among psychiatric disorders, reflect a complex behavioural profile not captured by a single dimension or questionnaire. In this study, we aim to dissect the specific contributions of observational and experiential learning to the decision-making process through computational modeling, identifying <b>transdiagnostic influences</b> using a multivariate approach.</p>

      <p>In the online study, participants (n~300) will complete an adapted version of a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abb4159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social influence task</a> previously administered in-person. The task - a two-alternative forced choice probabilistic reversal-learning paradigm -will be completed by <b>groups of five</b> in real time, also providing choices and confidence ratings before and after the choices of others in the group are revealed on-screen. The participants are therefore able to <b>adjust accordingly in response to social information</b>; either 'switching' or 'staying' with their initial choice. Participants will then complete a self-report questionnaire battery assessing multiple facets of psychopathology including social anxiety (LSAS-SR), depression/anxiety (DASS-21), apathy (AMI), and psychopathy (SRP-SF).</p>

      <p class="lead"><b>Investigating the relationship between HAemostatic function, VEssel health and Neurocognitive Health (HAVEN)</b></p>
      
      <p>The purpose of the <a href="https://research.reading.ac.uk/cinn/research-studies/haven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HAVEN study</a> was to investigate whether <b>blood function can affect the health of blood vessels around the body and in the brain, and how this relates to cognitive function in older life</b>. Previous research has shown that cardiovascular health conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes are linked to <b>worse brain health and cognitive function</b> in older adults.</p>
      
      <p>HAVEN included several neuroimaging measures in order to assess cognitive function, brain structure and the health of blood vessels in the brain. To this end we specifically used <b>structural MRI, functional MRI (fMRI), arterial spin labelling (ASL), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and angiography.</b></p>
