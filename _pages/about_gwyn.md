### Gwynnevere Suter - PhD Student (Psychology)
  

 I am a first-year Psychology PhD student funded by the College of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham. My supervisors are [Dr Emma ÄŒernis](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/cernis-emma.aspx), Dr Lei Zhang, and [Professor Ian Apperly](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/apperly-ian.aspx). I plan to investigate reality monitoring ability and the associated metacognitive efficiency across dissociation's subtypes and severity, considering how this can inform our characterisation of dissociation, our understanding of the relationship between dissociation and psychosis, and the distinctions used in dissociation research. The project will involve clinical and non-clinical samples, as well as employ cognitive, clinical, and functional neuroimaging techniques.

Prior to the PhD, I graduated with a first in Psychological and Behavioural Sciences (BA) from the University of Cambridge. During this, I collaborated with the Self and Body Lab (PI: Dr Jane Aspell) at Anglia Ruskin University, working on several research and public engagement projects.
