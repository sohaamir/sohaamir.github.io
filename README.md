This is the repository for my personal website, using the al-folio theme. For instructions on how to add some of the specific customizations I have made to my website including: 
- GIFs
- Changing your profile picture
- Adding a form which notifies you of submissions by email
- Changing your website favicon
  
.. among many others, please have a read of my blog post: [Setting up an academic website - a guide for absolute beginners](https://sohaamir.github.io/blog/2023/setting_up_website/). Whilst the guide was written for my older website, the same code can still be used.
