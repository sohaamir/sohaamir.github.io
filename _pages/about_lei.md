### Lei Zhang - Principal Investigator
  

I am an Associate Professor directing the Adaptive Learning Psychology & Neuroscience (ALPN) Lab, at the Centre for Human Brain Health and Institute for Mental Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, UK. 
 
Before joining Birmingham, I worked in the [Gläscher Lab](http://glascherlab.org/) (PhD, summa cum laude, and 1-year postdoc) at University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and I also worked as a [Roche intern for Scientific Exchange](https://careers.roche.com/global/en/ch-rise-program) (RiSE), based in the Clinical Computational Neuroscience Group at Roche Innovation Center Basel, Switzerland. I was then a Postdoc fellow in Social Decision Neuroscience at the [SCAN-Unit](https://scan-psy.univie.ac.at/), University of Vienna.
 
My research applies knowledge from cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and computational modeling to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the brain computes values and social information when making decisions. For that, I use behavioral measurements, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and Bayesian hierarchical modeling. 
 
Besides, I am deeply interested in Computational Psychiatry, to assess whether the same computational constructs preserve in psychiatric disorders, and how they might go awry at the neurocomputational level.
