### University of Birmingham (2023-25)

Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Cognitive Neuroscience (MSc module) (Module convenor: [Dr Magdalena Chechlacz](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/chechlacz-magda.aspx))

Served as a teaching assistant for practical workshops (25 students per class) covering: 
- Basics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data (file types, loading, reading and viewing files)
- Introduction to Programming (Linux, bash)
- Using FSL to perform neuroimaging analyses (diffusion MRI, resting-state and task-based fMRI)

Together with Magdalena Chechlacz and [Andrew Quinn](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/quinn-andrew), I created and actively maintain the [MRI-on-BEAR](https://chbh-opensource.github.io/mri-on-bear-edu/) website, which hosts the MRICN practical workshops. Within the module, I also created - and teach - the final weeks' workshop [on functional connectivity](https://chbh-opensource.github.io/mri-on-bear-edu/workshop8/functional-connectivity/).
