ðŸŽ‰ Fortunate to have had multiple successes this past week, including getting my [first paper](https://academic.oup.com/psyrad/advance-article/doi/10.1093/psyrad/kkae010/7664381) published (with Dr. Lei Zhang), receiving a bursary to attend [BACN 2024](https://www.bacn.co.uk/conferences), and being offered a place on both the competitive [CMMC](https://sites.uci.edu/cmmc/) and [NeuroBridges](https://neurobridges.net/) summer schools!
