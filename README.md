This is the repository for my personal website, using the al-folio theme. For instructions on how to add some of the specific customizations I have made to my website including: 
- GIFs
- Changing your profile picture
- Adding a form which notifies you of submissions by email
- Changing your website favicon
  
.. among many others, please have a read of my blog post: [Setting up an academic website - a guide for absolute beginners](https://sohaamir.github.io/blog/2023/setting_up_website/). Whilst the guide was written for my older website, the same code can still be used.

## A brief note on deployment

1. Open and run the Docker container (via Docker destop) for the website
2. Navigate in your terminal to the master branch of the website (e.g., /Users/aamirsohail/Documents/GitHub/sohaamir.github.io)
3. Open the website in the browser using http://localhost:8080/ 
4. Make changes to whatever file(s) you want
5. Have a look at your changes by refreshing the browser
6. If you are happy, commit the changes by running the following commands:

```
git status # this is to check that your changes are waiting to be commited
git add . 
git commit -m 'insert text about changes here'
git push origin
```
7. This should automatically deploy your website on GitHub!
